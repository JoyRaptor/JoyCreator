# Launch plan (drafted 2026-10-15 from six read-only audits in tasks/audits/)

Rule: nothing below marked DECISION gets built until the owner picks.

## A. Studio (finish first)
- [x] Sprite pin links, visualizer parent-follow, string resources (150 + 7 tool labels), token sweep, drawer inventories.
- [ ] Sprite warp net looks detached from the sprite (owner report 2026-10-15). Sonnet agent investigating; verify on phone.
- [x] Dialogs: the editor theme already styles dialogs; the one off-theme site (pin chooser) fixed. Remaining dialog work is strings and 11 non-MDC sites (studio_dialogs_audit.md).
- [x] Hover labels: audit said 201 uncovered, but reading each site showed helpers already name nearly all; the real gaps (bottom-bar tools, visualizer layer buttons, B/I/U, text motion, pivot, export stripe) are labelled.
- [ ] Drawer helper duplicates (studio_tools_audit.md top 10): TextOverlayDrawer.Kit aliasing ObjectDrawer.Kit, Kit.setChipOn View overload, grip pill, header toggle names.
- [ ] Colour picker hex field wraps on the phone (colour helper: owner said do not touch).

## B. Lobby (lobby_audit.md)
- [x] Joybot counted drawings/exports as recordings (fixed 35945e4c).
- [ ] DECISION: Viz Lab room has no screen: remove until built, or build one.
- [ ] DECISION: floor words (Bits -> Home, Packs and Setup both -> Setup, Finder -> Lab): real destination or cut.
- [ ] Move project and drawing reads off the main thread in onResume.
- [ ] Hero truth: Capture shows "Back camera" always; Sprite Lab/Avatar hero tags say LAST SHEET/CHARACTER over a project name; hero New goes to Studio list; storage readout uses an assumed 9 MB/s.
- [ ] ~40 lobby strings in code, none translated.

## C. Library and shared storage (storage_library_audit.md)
- [ ] Library (Records tab) shows only recordings, photos, exports. Make it read the Joy Creator folder index, add kind chips and working search.
- [ ] About a dozen storage roots still outside the shared space (avatars, fonts, voiceovers, drawing working copies).
- [ ] DECISION: five owner questions listed at the end of that report.

## D. VisLab and Joy Brush (vislab_joybrush_audit.md)
- [ ] WaveformDebugActivity is exported in the main manifest. DECISION: keep for adb testing or move to debug.
- [ ] Viz Lab destination (same as B).
- [ ] Joy Brush "Send to Studio" always makes a new project; add "into existing project". Nothing flows back to a drawing.
- [ ] Joy Brush DrawingsActivity uses a private palette; ~48 colour lines and ~166 strings hard-coded (Joy Brush lead's lane).

## E. Legacy FadCam screens (legacy_screens_audit.md)
- [ ] Restyle first: Home tab, Records tab and rows, onboarding, What's New, update sheet, Settings tab, mode popup, Home sidebar, fullscreen preview, Trash.
- [ ] Five activities ignore the Joy Creator theme (Onboarding, What's New, FadCam Pro, Cloud Account, WebView).
- [ ] DECISION (orphan rule: revive or remove, never delete unasked): 11 classes with no caller (list in report).


## Progress 2026-10-16 night (lead)
- [x] Library v2 built and verified on the Note 9 (kind chips with counts, search above keyboard, shared-in filter, bands, grid/list, classic view kept). Owner decisions still open (agent report): keep a "Clips" kind? empty chips faded vs hidden? voiceovers shown in a project view? lobby recording card opens the recording? safe helpers for renaming projects / trashing sprite sheets? lobby "N ITEMS" count to match Library. Lead's calls: keep Clips; keep faded; voiceovers with their project (needs a project view, later); recording card opens the recording; build the helpers; match the count.
- [x] Undo: drawer close hook was never cleared, so Mask/Chroma/Blend undo was lost from the second open; fixed (one-shot). Video overlay blend mode undoable. Visualizer slider drag = one undo step.
- [x] Colour picker hex field never wraps; shared SliderFace.
- [x] Follow-what dialog with numbered pin diagram; visualizer drawer in two columns and height-bounded; case button cycle.
- [ ] Settings hub v2 (agent running): new overlay fragment in ui/settingshub, classic settings kept.
- [ ] Then: Remote/Server Room, Smart Detection, recorder Home (Bits): same treatment, one screen at a time; before shots in tasks/screens/before/v_*.png.
- [ ] Sweep leftovers: caption motion "Type - word" stuck; caption hide-eye / outline swatch no visible response; Invert effect not visible on an image overlay; Puppet RECORDING tab button column clipped.
- [ ] Lobby: reads off the main thread; "N ITEMS" count to match Library; recording card opens the recording.

## JoyBrush engine continuation — October 16 (Codex Lead)

- [x] Bound canonical-source bake through actual engine publication and public undo/redo;
  source 97d0a51c full backend 876 and native 203 passed.
- [x] Incremental replay tile admission without diagnostic raw/sample caps on the opted-in
  renderer; source 8b40d6dcf full core 2442 (four existing optional skips), backend 878,
  native 203 and combined APK passed. Default recording/Select/save guards remain.
- [x] Exact-source captured joint Note9 acceptance (802 exact RGBA8 rows, 14 actual
  output-registration and budget-boundary checks) and ordinary regression (2082 exact rows,
  16 in-memory archive roundtrips). Owner Working / three archives unchanged.
- [ ] Review/test the isolated live scratch source lease and prepared-unit handoff, then
  connect one committed raw/seed/domain transaction without a preceding native pixel Step.
- [ ] Actual Select host, continued joint native/media/structural/paper edits, durable captured
  source save/cold load/Working/recovery/thumbnail/export. Then ready Media Atlas A2.

## Progress 2026-10-16 morning (lead)
- [x] Settings hub v2 verified on the Note 9 (sections, jump chips, search above keyboard, Torch opens, Back returns). Classic settings kept under About. Owner decisions in the agent report: results stack at the bottom (nearest thumb); clock-widget tap and Joybot "setup" still land on the classic tab; Ko-fi link still points at the original FadCam author (not in hub); Packs has no room of its own.
- [x] Drawer header toggles (Hide/Lock/Mute/Bypass/Pass-through) = one undo step each; verified.
- [x] Caption drawer opens above the preset strip (was printed over it); verified.
- [x] Caption motion "None" works (sweep "fail" was a mis-tap on a picker that moves between opens).
- [x] TextOverlayDrawer.Kit and slider track read ObjectDrawer.Kit / SliderFace.
- [ ] Projects mode in the Library + shared NewProjectFlow (Opus agent running); then retire the "Faditor Mini" list to the classic view.
- [ ] Remote / Server Room (1900-line legacy streaming screen): needs an owner call: is streaming-to-browser a launch feature? Parked.
- [ ] Known sweep leftovers: audio envelope Clear/In oddities; sprite Lanes tab pills sit over the preview edge; Invert effect on an image overlay unverified (test image mostly off-screen); Puppet RECORDING tab column clipped.
- [ ] Shared overlay helper OverlayNavUtil.dismiss hides the whole overlay but pops one level: Library -> Trash close path; fix in the helper (legacy, many callers) or in the new screens.

## Status 2026-10-17 (lead)
Done and pushed: slanted chips (Library/Trash/Settings), JoyBot switch everywhere, lobby truth pass, Recently Deleted v2, Library header cycles, onboarding permissions page, ~100 sheet strings, overlay child-close fix.
Running: Settings sub-screens restyle (Sonnet); What's New + update sheets + mode popup (Sonnet).
Open (owner decisions): Viz Lab card; bottom words (Packs/Bits/Finder); Remote/Server Room + Smart Detection; WaveformDebugActivity export; 11 orphan classes; New button behaviour; pill colour; rename "Classic view".
Open (mine): restyle Home recorder (Bits); fullscreen preview; Home sidebar; audio envelope oddities; voiceovers in project view; rename/trash helpers for sheets/characters; retire AvatarToggleView + eye-colour pref; sweep leftovers (caption presets retest).
Parked: VisLab (brief in tasks/VISLAB_BRIEF.md); Joy Brush send-into-existing-project.

## Adversarial audit — 2026-10-18
- [x] Locate active repository, read coordination rules, establish checked-out scope (24fc23790 plus existing working changes).
- [x] Dispatch read-only JoyBot, VisLab and JoyBrush reviewers.
- [x] Trace screen-recorder toggle and Studio integration failure paths.
- [x] Verify reviewer findings against reachable code and focused non-build checks; owner-authorized Note 9 pause/recorder checks and isolated brush microbench.
- [x] Deliver prioritized findings, JoyBot capability assessment, and performance recommendations in tasks/audits/2026-10-18/README.md.
Review constraints: no application edits, Gradle invocations, installs, merges, or model-service calls. Device testing became owner-authorized during the audit; phone returned Home, capture/visualiser stopped, lock released. Review: 28 findings (14 P1 / 14 P2), 424 agent helper checks plus Viz tests/probes; phone confirms pause load, capture interruption and stale toggle; 13 JoyBrush files unchanged after unsaved benches.

## Timeline marks and regions — owner-approved October 23, 2026
- [x] October 24 return audit: check current code/build/device evidence and locate remaining gaps.
- [x] Correct duplicate wheel touch handler so settling waits until release.
- [ ] Refresh focused marker checks and build evidence after the correction.
- [ ] Record exact BUILT/verified/pending status in STATE.md and both roadmaps.
- [ ] Remove only this task's obsolete temporary files after preserving durable results.
- [x] Preserve existing bookmark offsets; implement versioned named gradient points and regions.
- [x] Native compact popup: texture, shared icons, one-line times, cyan editing, smooth centered wheel.
- [x] Wire timestamp tap/hold, ruler marks, matching playhead colors, and undo/reload.
- [x] Connect active-region looping and selected-region export through existing composition/queue.
- [x] Compile/package and prove new symbols in the actual APK.
- [ ] Note 9 interaction, playback, and export acceptance when separately requested/available.
Spec: SPEC_TIMELINE_MARKS_20261023.md. User approval given in this chat; native build authorized.

Review October 24: saved undo payloads include complete marker metadata without changing normal
project/export JSON. Popup tap and long-press dispatch is explicit; landscape and larger text
retain reachable controls. Audio-first range export pads the mixed editor clock before clipping.
Initial APK attempts reached Java compilation, exposing an unfinished pre-existing draw-only
WaveformOverlayView refactor: obsolete gesture methods referenced removed fields. Completed
that removal, retaining the shared transform ownership described by the file. Build slot is
shared; no phone verification or install has been claimed. No test suites run in this continuation.

Build result: the shared primary-checkout `:app:assembleDefaultDebug` completed successfully
October 24 at 03:15 (3m 15s). Confirmed all six new marker/popup/loop-export integration symbols
in packaged DEX. Stable copy: `JoyCreator-timeline-marks-debug.apk` in this chat's visualization
folder. SHA-256: `ADB9F172FEE70CD3C533B5124E1A0D9651317FA59680D4BB21D25811DE2BE728`.
Phone interaction, actual loop timing, and exported file playback remain unverified.
